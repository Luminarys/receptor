WIP web frontend for [synapse](https://github.com/Luminarys/synapse).

[![](https://sr.ht/TkmY.png)](https://sr.ht/TkmY.png)

I really mean it when I say "WIP" here. There's only a few people that I want
bug reports from right now and they know who they are.

## Usage

Run synapse on localhost with the default RPC port.

```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000
